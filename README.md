There is one human player, and two computer opponents.
Each player is dealt seven cards.
Each player takes a turn to ask other players if they have a certain card in order to make a book of 4 cards, which they then lay down.
If the player they ask has that card or cards, they have to give them to the player, and the player goes again.
If the player they ask does not have that card, they have to "go fish", and draw a card from the deck.
This continues until one player has no more cards and has completed all of their books.
